# Administration XO for Second-in-Command

## Description

This adds an Administration XO to Second-in-Command. The intent is to provide a colony-focused XO that provides a lot of late-game utility to players with multiple colonies. Right now SiC avoids all colony-related abilities, so this exists to fill that gap.
